# PubMed Knowledgebase AI Chatbot powered by BioGPT
This chatbot web application allows you to interact with large language model Bio-GPT to query PubMed,which is an extensive and comprehensive biomedical literature knowledge database. This application not only aims at providing various context-based answers to targeted queries but also helping researches to explore potential subtle relationships.

### More about BioGPT:
BioGPT is a generative pre-trained transformer for biomedical text generation and mining developed by Mcrosoft. 
It is trained on millions of previously published biomedical research articles. 
The original paper about it can be found here [Article link](https://academic.oup.com/bib/article-abstract/23/6/bbac409/6713511?redirectedFrom=fulltext)

BioGPT can perform tasks such as answering questions, extracting relevant data, and generating text relevant to biomedical literature, 
for example, as a potential drug development application, BioGPT can generate descriptions of a specific therapeutic class—such as
 “Janus kinase 3 (JAK-3)”—or of a specific therapy—such as “Apricitabine.” If you are interested in more details about this, you can read this article [Article link](https://www.clinicaltrialsarena.com/news/biogpt-healthcare/?cf-view)
